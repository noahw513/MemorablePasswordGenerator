# memorablePassword
A Java shell program that generates a memorable password in the form word-word-word. Word count in the password can specified. Optionally, a special character may be appended to the end of the password: word-word-word-[!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *]. If no options are specified the program defaults to word-word-word.
